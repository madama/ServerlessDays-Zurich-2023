        "description": "This talk will present a modern approach to serverless, event-driven Google Cloud architectures that reveals how Google's commitment to open source and open standards improves developers' daily work and productivity. A demo will showcase how the open cloud approach allows for fast serverless development cycles through local development capabilities.<br/><br/>Take away #1: Developing and debugging event-driven architectures truly locally (EventArc, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions) even with external dependencies, is a valuable takeaway.<br/><br/>Take away #2: Fast and convenient debugging cycles are the key for effective and fun software development - how this is possible with cloud native (event driven/Serverless architectures) architectures is a takeaway of this talk.<br/><br/>Take away #3: You will also learn what benefits our open cloud approach (open sourcing and implementing open standards) has, on very concrete examples.",
        "about": "I'm a Strategic Cloud Engineer at Google, focused on containerized application modernization and serverless application development. NodeJS and Typescript are my preferred tools to go fast.<br/>Before Google, I worked at AWS and MaibornWolff building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Austria, I enjoy being close to the ‘cloud’ during mountaineering as well."

        "description": "Over the past 2 years we learnt a lot about what it takes to build a serverless platform: what it means to be serverless-first, what works well, what doesn’t, but above all we learnt to love the serverless offering on AWS. This talk describes our Serverless education, warts and all, in the hope that you can learn from it.<br/><br/>We will discuss topics like why you shouldn’t try to stuff a Monolith into a Lambda, how you can avoid Lambda functions entirely, when to make use of Step Functions and what valuable advice you can take from the Well-Architected Framework. The talk is for anyone considering, or partially along, their transition to Serverless.<br/><br/>This talk is split into the four key phases of our project<br/><br/>Phase 1 - The GraphQL Lambdalith In this section I discuss how our project was first structured, a lambdalith running Apollo Server. We then break this architecture down to use AppSync instead with multiple lambda resolvers. Then we discuss the pros and cons of this approach.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - Going Lambda-less In this section we discuss the next major step for our project, replacing some of our direct lambda resolvers with DynamoDB resolvers instead. I dive into cold starts and how direct service integrations eliminate the need to worry about them.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Thinking in events Not all event driven applications are serverless, but all serverless applications are event driven. Is this true? In this section I discuss how I noticed that our team started to think in an event driven way without ever being instructed to do so.<br/><br/>Phase 4 - Step Functions How do we use step functions in production? How do you test step functions? How do you deploy step functions? All questions we have asked and now have answers to. But there are some gotchas that could catch teams out, mainly where do you keep your business logic so that your state machines will be easy to \"reason about\".",

In this session, you will get the big picture of what is in the Azure platform and see by examples, when to use what. Also, we will unveil the top five architecture tips for building successful serverless apps on Azure. We will touch Logic Apps, Functions, Automation, Azure Notebooks, Containers, Machine Learning and more.",

        "description": "The principles of chaos engineering have been battle-tested for years using traditional infrastructure and containerized microservices. But how do they work with Serverless functions and managed services? In this session, we'll cover the principles of chaos engineering, how to design and run chaos experiments, and specific weaknesses that you can test. Together we will dive deeper into how chaos engineering can be safely performed in Lambda functions using open-source libraries and different AWS tools. By attending this session, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to improve the reliability and resilience of your Serverless application and be better equipped to handle unexpected failures and outages.",
